                    &emsp;&emsp;I, Deba(Debobrata Patra), am the Founder to The Storytellers' room. 
                    I am an IT engineering student of Netaji Subhash Engineering College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Basically, I'm a musician, photographer by hobby. My work in the field 
                    of audio mastering started from this family only. In the beginning, I thought only 
                    about the students of boards examination who would learn fast by hearing these 
                    stories, but later I decided to do something for the everyone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The Storytellers' room(STR) is not just a storytelling group, it's 
                    just like my second family. A place where an auspicious members are gifted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I hope it serves a great purpose and reaches out to people and 
                    attains success in entertaining them.
